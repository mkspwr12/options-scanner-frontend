# Jobs & Steps Patterns

> Load when configuring job dependencies and conditional execution. See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for concepts.

## Job Dependencies

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Building..."

  test:
    needs: build  # Wait for build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Testing..."

  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to staging..."

  deploy-prod:
    needs: [test, deploy-staging]  # Multiple dependencies
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## Conditional Jobs

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Always runs"

  deploy-dev:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploy to dev"

  deploy-prod:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploy to prod"

  manual-step:
    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Manual trigger"
```

## Conditional Steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Run on main branch only
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: echo "Main branch"

  - name: Run on PR only
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    run: echo "Pull request"

  - name: Run on success
    if: success()
    run: echo "Previous steps succeeded"

  - name: Run on failure
    if: failure()
    run: echo "Previous steps failed"

  - name: Always run
    if: always()
    run: echo "Runs regardless of status"

  - name: Run on cancelled
    if: cancelled()
    run: echo "Workflow was cancelled"
```

## Runner Selection

```yaml
jobs:
  linux:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Linux"

  windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Windows"

  macos:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "macOS"

  self-hosted:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
    steps:
      - run: echo "Self-hosted runner"

  specific-version:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04  # Specific version
    steps:
      - run: echo "Ubuntu 22.04"
```
