## Basic Release Pipeline

```yaml

  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'

jobs:
  validate:

## Multi-Environment Release Pipeline

```yaml
# Azure Pipelines
trigger:
  tags:
    include:
      - v*.*.*

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - script: dotnet build -c Release
    - script: dotnet publish -c Release -o $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
    - publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)

- stage: DeployStaging
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployStaging
    environment: staging
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - download: current
            artifact: drop
          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: 'Azure-Staging'
              appName: 'myapp-staging'

- stage: SmokeTests
  dependsOn: DeployStaging
  jobs:
  - job: SmokeTestsJob
    steps:
    - script: |
        curl -f https://staging.example.com/health || exit 1
        npm run test:smoke -- --env=staging

- stage: DeployProduction

    steps:
    - script: |
        curl -f https://app.example.com/health || exit 1
        npm run test:smoke -- --env=production
    - script: echo "Notifying stakeholders..."
