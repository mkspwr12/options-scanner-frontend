# Pipeline Design Patterns

> Load when designing pipeline architecture. See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for pattern selection.

## Sequential Stages Pattern

```yaml
# Azure Pipelines
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building..."

- stage: Test
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - job: TestJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Testing..."

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: Test
  jobs:
  - job: DeployJob
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying..."
```

## Parallel Jobs Pattern

```yaml
# GitLab CI
stages:
  - test

test:unit:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:unit

test:integration:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:integration

test:e2e:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:e2e
```

## Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern

```yaml
# Azure Pipelines
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building..."

- stage: ParallelTests
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - job: UnitTests
    steps:
    - script: echo "Unit tests..."

  - job: IntegrationTests
    steps:
    - script: echo "Integration tests..."

  - job: E2ETests
    steps:
    - script: echo "E2E tests..."

- stage: Deploy
  dependsOn: ParallelTests  # Waits for all parallel jobs
  jobs:
  - job: Deploy
    steps:
    - script: echo "Deploying..."
```

## Canary Deployment Pattern

```yaml
# GitLab CI
deploy:canary:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/canary/
  environment:
    name: production/canary
    url: https://canary.example.com
  only:
    - main
  when: manual

deploy:production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://example.com
  only:
    - main
  when: manual
  needs:
    - deploy:canary
```
