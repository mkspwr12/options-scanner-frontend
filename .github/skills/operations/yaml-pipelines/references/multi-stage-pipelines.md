> Load when implementing multi-stage deployment pipelines. See [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) for concepts.

## Azure Multi-Stage with Approvals

```yaml
stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: Build
    steps:
    - script: echo "Building..."

- stage: DeployDev
  dependsOn: Build
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployDev
    environment: development  # No approval
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: echo "Deploy to dev"

- stage: DeployQA
  dependsOn: DeployDev
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployQA
    environment: qa  # Configure approval in environment settings
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: echo "Deploy to QA"

- stage: DeployProd
  dependsOn: DeployQA
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployProd
    environment: production  # Requires approval
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: echo "Deploy to production"
```

## GitLab Multi-Environment

```yaml
stages:
  - build

  - deploy:dev
  - deploy:staging
  - deploy:prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy:dev:
  stage: deploy:dev
  script:
    - npm run deploy:dev
  environment:
    name: development
  only:
    - develop

deploy:staging:
  stage: deploy:staging
  script:
    - npm run deploy:staging
  environment:
    name: staging
  only:
    - main

deploy:production:
  stage: deploy:prod
  script:

  environment:
    name: production
  only:
    - main
  when: manual
