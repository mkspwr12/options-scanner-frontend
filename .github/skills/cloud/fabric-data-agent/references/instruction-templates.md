## Template Structure

Every Data Agent instruction (system prompt) should follow this structure:

```
1. Role definition — Who the agent is
2. Data context — What data is available
3. Business rules — Domain-specific calculations
4. Response guidelines — How to format answers
5. Limitations — What the agent cannot do
```

## Customization Checklist

When creating a new agent instruction:

- [ ] Replace all `{placeholder}` values with actual business values
- [ ] Verify table and column names match the actual Lakehouse schema
- [ ] Validate business rules with domain expert / stakeholder
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty results, null values, large numbers)
- [ ] Review for clarity — a non-technical user should understand the rules
- [ ] Keep under 500 words (agent performance degrades with long instructions)
