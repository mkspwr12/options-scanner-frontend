# YAML / Configuration Instructions

> **Note**: For GitHub Actions workflow-specific patterns, see `devops.instructions.md` which also applies to `*.yml`/`*.yaml`.

## Code Style

- Indent with 2 spaces (NEVER tabs)
- Use `yamllint` for linting
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use block style (not flow style) for readability

## Formatting Rules

```yaml
# MUST: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
parent:
  child:
    grandchild: value

# MUST: Quote strings that could be misinterpreted
version: "3.8"         # Not 3.8 (would be float)
enabled: "true"        # Not true (would be boolean) — unless boolean is intended
port: "8080"           # Not 8080 (would be integer) — unless integer is intended

# SHOULD: Use block scalars for multi-line strings
description: |
  This is a long description
  that spans multiple lines.

# SHOULD: Use folded scalars for wrapped paragraphs
summary: >
  This is a long paragraph that will be
  folded into a single line with a trailing newline.
```

## GitHub Actions Workflows

```yaml
# MUST: Pin action versions to full SHA (not tags)
- uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11  # v4.1.1

# MUST: Set explicit permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

# MUST: Set timeout on all jobs
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

# SHOULD: Use environment variables for repeated values
env:
  NODE_VERSION: "20"
  DOTNET_VERSION: "9.0.x"
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml
# MUST: Pin image versions (never use :latest in production)
services:
  api:
    image: myapp/api:1.2.3
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
          cpus: "0.5"
```

## Kubernetes Manifests

```yaml
# MUST: Include resource limits and requests
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api
  labels:
    app: api
    version: v1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: myapp/api:1.2.3
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "100m"
            limits:
              memory: "512Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /ready
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
```

## Azure Pipelines

```yaml
# MUST: Use template references for reusable stages
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main
      - release/*

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildApp
        timeoutInMinutes: 15
        steps:
          - task: UseDotNet@2
            inputs:
              version: "9.0.x"
          - script: dotnet build --configuration Release
            displayName: "Build"
```

## Security

- MUST NOT hardcode secrets in YAML files
- MUST use `${{ secrets.NAME }}` (GitHub Actions) or variable groups (Azure Pipelines)
- MUST pin action/image versions (SHA for actions, tag for images)
- SHOULD use environment protection rules for production deployments
- MUST set least-privilege permissions in workflow files

## Common Anti-Patterns

```yaml
# BAD: Unpinned action version
- uses: actions/checkout@main        # Never use branch reference

# GOOD: Pinned to SHA
- uses: actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11  # v4.1.1

# BAD: No timeout (job can run forever)
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

# GOOD: Explicit timeout
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15

# BAD: Wildcard permissions
permissions: write-all

# GOOD: Least privilege
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
```

## Validation

- Use `yamllint` to catch syntax and formatting errors
- Use `actionlint` for GitHub Actions workflow validation
- Use `kubeval` or `kubeconform` for Kubernetes manifest validation
- Use schema validation for custom YAML formats
